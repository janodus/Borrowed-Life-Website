# Borrowed-Life-Website

Borrowed Life is a creative apparel company with an amazing story: Mia had her toes cut off after a horrendous train accident. Now she's showing the world why life isn't so bad, and how we should enjoy every minute. 

The website runs on Wordpress, and the shop is set up with a WooCommerce plugin. The page has been updated several times AFTER my involvement in its creation.
